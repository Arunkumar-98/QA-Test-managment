3. **Opens confirmation dialog** with count of test cases
4. **User confirms deletion**
5. **All test cases are deleted**

### **Smart Selection Logic:**
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  // Select all test cases and then delete
  const allTestCaseIds = paginatedTestCases.map(tc => tc.id)
  onToggleSelectAll(allTestCaseIds)
  setTimeout(() => setIsBulkDeleteDialogOpen(true), 100)
}}
```

### **Safety Features:**

- ✅ **Cannot Undo Warning**: Clear warning about permanent deletion

- **Compact Buttons**: Small size with icons
- **Red Indicator Bar**: Full-width selection indicator

### **Mobile (below lg):**
- **Vertical Layout**: Buttons stacked vertically
- **Full-Width Buttons**: `flex-1` for equal width
- **Compact Design**: Optimized for touch interaction

2. **Bulk Selection**: Use "Delete All" to select all test cases
