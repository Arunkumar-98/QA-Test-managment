# 🔒 User Isolation Fix Guide

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**

Your current QA Management System has **NO USER ISOLATION**. This means:
- ❌ All users can see each other's projects
- ❌ All users can see each other's test cases
- ❌ All users can modify each other's data
- ❌ Complete data privacy violation!

## 🔧 **The Fix**

### **Step 1: Apply the Database Changes**

**Option A: Using the API (Recommended)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/fix-user-isolation
```

**Option B: Manual SQL Execution**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-user-isolation.sql`
4. Execute the script

### **Step 2: What the Fix Does**

1. **Adds `user_id` column** to all tables
2. **Enables Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables
3. **Creates RLS policies** that ensure users only see their own data
4. **Updates database functions** to include user context
5. **Creates indexes** for better performance

### **Step 3: After the Fix**

✅ **Each user will only see their own:**
- Projects
- Test Cases
- Test Suites
- Documents
- Important Links
- Comments
- Status History
- Saved Filters

✅ **Complete data isolation**
✅ **Proper security**
✅ **Multi-tenant architecture**

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Create two different user accounts**
2. **Login as User A** and create some test cases
3. **Login as User B** - you should see an empty system
4. **Create test cases as User B**
5. **Switch back to User A** - you should only see User A's data

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Existing Data**
- If you have existing data, it will need to be migrated
- The script includes commented lines for data migration
- Uncomment and modify as needed for your specific case

### **Backup First**
- Always backup your database before applying schema changes
- Test in a development environment first

### **Service Role Key**
- The fix requires the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- This bypasses RLS to apply the changes
- Keep this key secure

## 🔍 **Verification**

After applying the fix, verify:

1. **Check RLS is enabled:**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('projects', 'test_cases', 'test_suites');
```

2. **Check policies exist:**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

3. **Check user_id columns:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'test_cases' 
AND column_name = 'user_id';
```

## 🚀 **Benefits After Fix**

- ✅ **Complete data privacy**
- ✅ **Multi-user support**
- ✅ **Enterprise-ready security**
- ✅ **Compliance with data protection regulations**
- ✅ **Proper user isolation**

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs
2. Verify all SQL commands executed successfully
3. Test with multiple user accounts
4. Contact support if needed
