# 👥 Team Collaboration System Guide

## 🎯 **Perfect Solution for Your Team of 4!**

This system provides exactly what you wanted:
- ✅ **Private projects** for each user
- ✅ **Project sharing** with team members
- ✅ **Visual indicators** (tags like "Shared by [Name]", "Shared Project")
- ✅ **Full change history** showing who made what changes
- ✅ **Owner controls** (add/remove members, change permissions)

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Private Projects**
- Each user creates their own private projects
- Only the owner can see and manage their private projects
- Complete data isolation by default

### **2. Project Sharing**
- Project owners can share projects with team members
- Three permission levels: **View**, **Edit**, **Admin**
- Shared projects appear in team members' project lists

### **3. Visual Indicators**
- **Own Projects**: No special tags
- **Shared Projects**: Show "Shared by [Owner Name]" and permission level
- **Permission Badges**: 👁️ View, ✏️ Edit, 👑 Admin

### **4. Activity Tracking**
- Every change is logged with user information
- Full history of who did what and when
- Activity feed shows recent changes

### **5. Owner Controls**
- Add/remove team members
- Change permission levels
- View all activity
- Manage project access

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Apply the Schema**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/apply-team-collaboration
```

### **Step 2: Manual Setup (Alternative)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste `team-collaboration-schema.sql`
4. Execute the script

## 📋 **User Experience**

### **For Project Owners:**
1. **Create private projects** (only you can see them)
2. **Share with team members** via email
3. **Set permission levels** (View/Edit/Admin)
4. **Monitor activity** and changes
5. **Manage team access** (add/remove members)

### **For Team Members:**
1. **See shared projects** in your project list
2. **Clear indicators** showing who shared it
3. **Permission-based access** (can only do what you're allowed)
4. **View activity history** of the project
5. **Collaborate** with other team members

## 🎨 **Visual Examples**

### **Project List View:**
```
📁 My Private Project                    [Owner]
📁 Team Project Alpha                   [Shared by john@company.com] [Edit]
📁 Client Testing Suite                 [Shared by sarah@company.com] [View]
📁 Bug Fixes Sprint                     [Shared by mike@company.com] [Admin]
```

## 🔐 **Permission Levels**

### **👁️ View Only**
- Can view project and test cases
- Can view activity history
- Cannot make any changes

### **✏️ Edit**
- Can view project and test cases
- Can create/edit test cases

- Cannot delete or share the project

### **👑 Admin**
- Full access to the project
- Can add/remove team members

- Cannot delete the project (only owner can)

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **New Tables:**
- `project_members` - Tracks who has access to shared projects
- `project_activity_log` - Records all changes and activities

### **Enhanced Tables:**
- All existing tables now have `user_id` field
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure proper access control

### **Key Functions:**
- `share_project_with_user()` - Share project with team member
- `remove_user_from_project()` - Remove team member
- `get_user_projects()` - Get own + shared projects
- `log_project_activity()` - Log changes for history

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### **Test Scenario:**
1. **User A** creates a project "Team Alpha"
2. **User A** shares it with **User B** (Edit permission)
3. **User B** sees "Team Alpha" in their project list with "Shared by userA@email.com" tag
4. **User B** can edit test cases but cannot delete the project
5. **User A** can see all activity in the project history
6. **User A** can remove **User B** from the project

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **User A** sees their private project + shared projects
- ✅ **User B** sees only the shared project
- ✅ **Clear visual indicators** for shared projects
- ✅ **Activity tracking** shows who made changes
- ✅ **Permission enforcement** works correctly
