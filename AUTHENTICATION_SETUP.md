# Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up user authentication for your QA Management application so you can share it with your team.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

Run the following SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor to enable authentication:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase-auth-schema.sql
```

This will:
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Add `user_id` columns to all tables
- Create RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own data
- Set up automatic triggers to assign user IDs on data creation

### 2. Supabase Authentication Settings

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Settings**
3. Configure the following:

#### Email Templates
- **Confirm signup**: Customize the email template for account verification
- **Reset password**: Customize the password reset email template

#### Auth Settings
- **Enable email confirmations**: Turn this ON for production
- **Enable phone confirmations**: Turn OFF (not used in this app)
- **JWT expiry**: Set to 3600 (1 hour) or your preference

#### Site URL
- Set your deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

### 3. Environment Variables

Make sure your environment variables are set correctly:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
