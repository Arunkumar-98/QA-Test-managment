# 🚨 URGENT SECURITY FIX NEEDED

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**
You're seeing projects from another account because there's a **critical security breach** in the application. The `projectService.getAll()` method was not filtering by user ID, allowing all users to see all projects.

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED**

### 1. **Code Fix (Already Done)**
I've fixed the following methods in `lib/supabase-service.ts`:
- ✅ `projectService.getAll()` - Now filters by current user
- ✅ `projectService.getById()` - Now filters by current user  
- ✅ `projectService.delete()` - Now filters by current user

### 2. **Database Fix (You Need to Run This)**

**Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor and run the entire content of `URGENT_USER_ISOLATION_FIX.sql`**

This will:
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Create proper security policies
- Ensure users can only see their own data

## 🚀 **Quick Steps to Fix**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy the entire content** from `URGENT_USER_ISOLATION_FIX.sql`
4. **Paste and click "Run"**
5. **Refresh your application**

## 🔒 **What This Fixes**

- ✅ Users can only see their own projects
- ✅ Users can only see their own test cases
- ✅ Users can only see their own test suites
- ✅ Users can only see their own documents
- ✅ Users can only see their own comments
- ✅ Users can only see their own status history
- ✅ Users can only see their own saved filters

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

After running the SQL script:
1. **Log out** of your current account
2. **Log in** with a different email
3. **Verify** you only see projects for that account
4. **Log back in** to your original account
5. **Verify** you only see your original projects

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- This is a **critical security fix** - run it immediately
- The fix is **backward compatible** - existing data is preserved
- **No data loss** - only access control is changed
- **Performance impact** - minimal, RLS is very efficient

## 🆘 **If Issues Persist**

If you still see other users' data after running the fix:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Check browser console** for any errors
4. **Verify** the SQL script ran successfully in Supabase

## 📞 **Emergency Contact**

If you need immediate assistance, the fix is in the `URGENT_USER_ISOLATION_FIX.sql` file. Run it in Supabase SQL Editor as soon as possible.
