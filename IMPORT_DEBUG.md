# üîß Import Debug Guide

## üö® Current Issue: 0 Test Cases Imported

### **Problem Analysis:**
- **0 Test Cases** imported
- **9 Skipped** (duplicates)  
- **10 Errors** occurred
- **"Expected result is missing"** warnings

### **Root Causes:**

#### **1. Field Mapping Issues**
The Enhanced Import Dialog might not be using the legacy field mapping function that handles different column header variations.

#### **2. Validation Errors**
The system is showing 10 errors, which means the validation is failing for the data.

#### **3. Required Fields Missing**
The TestCase type has many required fields that might not be getting default values.

## üéØ **SOLUTION: Use These Test Files**

I've created several test files with different approaches:

### **File 1: `test-import-minimal.csv`** (Most Basic)
```csv
Test Case,Description,Expected Result,Status,Priority,Category
TC999,Test login functionality,User should login successfully,Pending,High,Functional
```

### **File 2: `test-import-perfect.csv`** (Exact Field Names)
```csv
testCase,description,expectedResult,status,priority,category,assignedTester,environment,platform,prerequisites,stepsToReproduce
```

### **File 3: `test-import-working.csv`** (Field Mapping Compatible)
```csv
Test Case,Description,Expected Result,Status,Priority,Category,Assigned Tester,Environment,Platform,Prerequisites,Steps to Reproduce
```

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Debug Process**

### **Step 1: Try the Minimal File**
1. Use `test-import-minimal.csv` 
2. This has only 6 fields - the absolute minimum
3. Should show what specific validation is failing

### **Step 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try importing
4. Look for specific error messages

### **Step 3: Test Field Mapping**
1. Try `test-import-working.csv`
2. This uses the exact header names that the mapping function recognizes
3. Should resolve field mapping issues

## üîç **Expected Behavior**

### **If Validation is Working:**
- Should show specific field errors
- Should indicate which rows have issues
- Should provide suggestions for fixes

### **If Field Mapping is Working:**
- Should recognize all column headers
- Should map data to correct fields
- Should apply default values for missing fields

### **If Import is Working:**
- Should import at least 1 test case
- Should show success message
- Should display imported test cases in table

## üÜò **If Still Failing**

### **Check These:**
1. **Project Selection**: Make sure a project is selected before import
2. **Database Connection**: Verify the app can save test cases manually
3. **Import Dialog**: Make sure you're using the "Enhanced Import" not legacy import
4. **File Encoding**: Ensure CSV files are UTF-8 encoded

### **Alternative Test:**
Try creating a test case manually first to verify the system is working, then try importing.

## üìã **Quick Success Test**

**Copy this exact content into a new file called `debug-test.csv`:**

```csv
Test Case,Description,Expected Result,Status,Priority,Category
DEBUG001,Debug test case,Should import successfully,Pending,High,Functional
```

**This single-row file should work 100% if the system is functional.**
