User Stories:
- As a user, I want to log in so I can access my account
- As a user, I want to be remembered so I don't have to log in repeatedly
- As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it
- As a user, I want to be protected from unauthorized access
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you get "Gemini API key not configured":
1. Check that `.env.local` file exists
2. Verify the API key is correct
3. Restart your development server

### If generation fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the PRD content is not empty
3. Try with a shorter PRD first

### If no test cases are generated:
1. Make sure your PRD has enough detail
2. Include specific requirements and user stories
